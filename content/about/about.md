Hi, I'm Aaron Simumba, welcome to my website.
---------------------------------------------
***
In my current job, I work for [**mPharma**](https://www.mpharma.com/) as a Data Management Associate. 
In another life, I am an Accounting and Finance major. Graduated from the [**University of Namibia**](http://unam.edu.na/) with a BA degree in Accounting(Honours). Previously tutored Business Administration students in the art of business and accounting at the [**University of Zambia**](https://www.unza.zm/).

I am lost in the Data Science web... hoping to find my way out of the maze soon. I find data and the process of data analysis to glean insight from the raw data, overly exciting and fascinating alike.

In addition, I'm fascinated by stock markets and everything with a business and finance buzz.

I can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/asimumba/) poking around interesting projects... and occasionally I rant on [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/zedsamurai/).

`For this website`

>This will be a place where I share my daily musings in the world of R, Stock markets, and mostly, everything remotely interesting. I have a knack for learning interesting data analytics technologies.

`Let's have fun!` :smile:
