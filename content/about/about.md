Hi, I'm Aaron Simumba, welcome to my site.


In another life, I am an Accounting and Finance major. Graduated from the [Univeristy of Namibia](http://unam.edu.na/) with a BA degree in Accounting(Honours). For my part time activities, I explain to or is it tutor Business Administration students in the art of business and accounting at the [University of Zambia](https://www.unza.zm/).

Not to mention, I am lost in the Data Science web... I hope to find my way out of the maze soon. In addition, I am fascinated by stock markets and everything with a business and finance buzz. More like I am the middle part of a sandwich.

`For this website`

This will be a place where I share my daily musings in the world of R, Stock markets, and mostly, everything remotely interesting. I have a knack for learning interesting data analytics technologies.

`Let's have fun!` :smile:
