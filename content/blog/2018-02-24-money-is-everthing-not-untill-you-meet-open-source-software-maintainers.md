For profit centred enterprises, it is not surprising when you encounter their overly aggressive marketing campaigns, which mostly have an end result of them trying to squeeze every penny from you as a customer. At the end of the day, you pay even for a service and product that is not satisfactory or worse, not worth you hard earned money.

Conversely, for a few months now, I have been using many Open Source Software. Oh boy!, it is amazing to see and interact with many people that are involved in these projects, treat and welcome you whole heartedly for no less than a "thank you". Open source software developers have to be some of the nicest people I have come across. 

It is natural to receive attention when it is financially beneficial to the giver and receiver. But for OSS developers, they seem to take pride in simply being there to help make people's live better. The painstakingly patience is astonishing. Not even the most stupid questions seem to bother many of them. 

If there is something I have learned, is, if you are passionate about something, eventually you will dedicate you time to make it come to fruition, even at the expense of your own free time. This is my an unsolicited  "thank you" to all the OSS developers.
