In this short post. I will detail my journey building my website using [__blogdown__](https://github/rstudio/blogdown) an [__R__](https://r-project.org) package that makes use of the static website generator [__Hugo__](https://gohugo.io). This is a great R package, written by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en). 

For starters, there is [offical documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) which is so far still under developement, but nonetheless it has already covered most of the pertinent issues to get you started buiding your own desired website. 

If you are coming from the _Google blogspot_ or _wordpress_ dungeon, then by default I will assume you are going to love this new introduction to the blogsphere. It's worth to make mention though that this, may not look quite easy and appealing to people with very little computers/tech aquaintance. For your own information, I used to be an Accounting/finace major in another life; apparently things had to balance, maybe so, some of the world's things have to find a reconciliation point after all. This I hope if you've never built a website or even a blog it will help you believe you can do it, just the way I am doing it!

Enough with the stories, buckle up we jump right into it.
