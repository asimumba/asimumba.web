Hi, I'm Aaron Simumba, welcome to my website.
-----------------------------------------
In another life, I am an Accounting and Finance major. Graduated from the [**University of Namibia**](http://unam.edu.na/) with a BA degree in Accounting(Honours). For my part time activities, I tutor Business Administration students in the art of business and accounting at the [**University of Zambia**](https://www.unza.zm/).

Not to mention, I am lost in the Data Science web... I hope to find my way out of the maze soon. In addition, I'm fascinated by stock markets and everything with a business and finance buzz. 

I can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/asimumba/) poking around interesting projects... and occasionally I rant on [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/zedsamurai/).

`For this website`

This will be a place where I share my daily musings in the world of R, Stock markets, and mostly, everything remotely interesting. I have a knack for learning interesting data analytic technologies.

`Let's have fun!` :smile:
