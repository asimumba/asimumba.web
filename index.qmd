Hi, I'm **Aaron Simumba**, welcome to my website.

I work in the financial services sector as a **Business Intelligence & Analytics Lead**. Previously, I worked for [**mPharma**](https://www.mpharma.com/) as a **Data Management Associate**.

In another life, I was an Accounting and Finance major. Graduated from the [**University of Namibia**](http://unam.edu.na/) with a BA degree in Accounting(Honours). Equally tutored Business Administration students in the art of business and accounting at the [**University of Zambia**](https://www.unza.zm/).

I am lost in the Data Science web... hoping to find my way out of the maze soon. I find data and the process of data analysis to glean insight from the raw data, overly exciting and fascinating alike.

I'm equally fascinated by stock markets and everything with a business and finance buzz.

I can be found on [**Github**](https://github.com/asimumba/) poking around interesting projects... and occasionally I rant on [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/asimumba_/).

For this website:

> This will be a place where I share my daily musings in the world of R, analytics and mostly, everything remotely interesting. I have a knack for learning interesting data analytics technologies.

**Let's have fun!** 😁
