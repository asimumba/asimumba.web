      <description>There is nothing as frustrating as getting stuck with a computer operation/code bug, which you know no better how to get around it. That was my frustration while trying to deploy my website through netlify. Having changed the theme I was initially working with to the new theme, Cactus. I later discovered, the theme is only compatible with version 0.20 and above of the static site generator hugo. After hours of trying to debug what the problem might be to no avail.</description>

      <description>In this short post. I will detail my journey building my website using blogdown an R package that makes use of the static website generator Hugo. This is a great R package, written by Yihui Xie.
For starters, there is offical documentation which is so far still under developement, but nonetheless it has already covered most of the pertinent issues to get you started buiding your own desired website.
If you are coming from the Google blogspot or wordpress dungeon, then by default I will assume you are going to love this new introduction to the blogsphere.</description>
