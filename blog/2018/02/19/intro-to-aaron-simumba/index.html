    <h1>Thoughts to Words - An Introduction to Aaron Simumba&#39;s Website</h1>

    
        
    

    <p>This post was originally submitted to the <a href="https://support.rbind.io/2018/02/19/introduction-to-aaron-simumba-website/">Rbind support</a> website.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Aaron Simumba, and you can find my website on the following URL: <a href="https://asimumba.rbind.io/">https://asimumba.rbind.io/</a>. And on  <a href="https://github.com/asimumba">Github</a>, plus you can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/asimumba21">Twitter</a>. A brief background about myself: I often like to refer to myself as a &ldquo;Lost Accountant&rdquo; - because professionally I trained as an accountant, who lost his way to practise accounting and ended up into the data science space. I was excited to be in finance and accounting, I loved all the glory that came with working with financial data. But at heart, I loved computers and statistics. Statistics was probably one of my favourite courses at university. If there is one thing I got out of the accounting degree was that: &ldquo;Debits should equal credits and vice versa&rdquo;; and this has been my motivation to try to always find a reconciliation point for all I do.</p>
<h2 id="blogging-journey">Blogging journey</h2>
<p>I have always had a knack to express my thoughts. Previously I blogged with <code>blogger</code> and <code>Wordpress</code>. Mostly I blogged about random stuff that today I am ashamed to re-read. But that provided a very good foundation for harnessing my interest in blogging.</p>
<h2 id="getting-lost-in-the-wilderness">Getting lost in the wilderness</h2>
<p>During my final undergraduate year, I so looked forward to finishing and venture into other interesting life persuasions. But that was one half of finishing all the university business - the other half involved writing my final year thesis. I was happy to finally get on with challenging my thought process. Unfortunately this enthusiasm was short lived. SPSS was in my way! I hated the work process of analysis in SPSS, and then copy the output to Microsoft word. Oh lord! cant there be something better? At the end of the day I went on with this process until the bitter end.</p>
<p>Post university, I started looking for a better analysis environment, luckily I stumbled on R and all the tools in its ecosystem. And as you can guess I have not looked back. Been using R and its tools for  now 1 year 7 months. If I&rsquo;m to describe the experience, I would say, it&rsquo;s been fun and challenging. With plenty of promises for the future.</p>
<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
<p>If there is one thing hard to be satisfied with is the visual aesthetics of the website. I first created my <strong>blogdown</strong> powered website in 2017 right around July. But between then and now, I have changed a minimum four website themes. This was mainly due the fact I had zero knowledge of <code>HTML</code>, let alone <code>CSS</code>. I took each theme as it came and simply replaced template filled sections with my own details. This left a hole which needed to be filled. I wanted to have control over even the most miniature website aspect. Fast forward, I crashed HTML and CSS courses to try and learn enough skills to be dangerous, of course in a minimal way. I want to thank <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihui Xie</a>, from whom I have learnt a lot. His blog has great material to both his tools and his take on other open source software. Of course don&rsquo;t forget to read the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown book</a>.</p>
<p>My website is built on the <code>hugo</code>, <code>github</code>, <code>netlify</code> and <code>blogdown</code> platform. I am using the <a href="https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo">Beautiful Hugo</a> theme. I like this theme for the following reasons: natively it comes with support for syntax highlighting, mathjax, a big image cover for the landing page and photoswipe, embedding a gallery of images is something I wanted.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398851/36398695-035a64fe-15d1-11e8-87b1-6a7c5ab65ad9.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>The theme has quite a clean design, which you can get started with a new website in minutes. Minimalistic design if you decide to strip out the images. Looking at the amount of work I did to achieve the visual effects as seen below. I must say I&rsquo;m pleased and happy to call this a personal website!</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398851/36397146-09733e62-15ca-11e8-9be1-a91244efc209.jpg" alt="website"></p>
<p>I broke and repositioned a lot of the native features to achieve the design as seen above. I let go of the avatar container on the navigation bar, re-aligned the navbar links to the right from their original left hand position. Added font awesome icons to some links.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398851/36397152-0f79484c-15ca-11e8-9974-f8be9bef098a.png" alt="navbar"></p>
<p>For the landing page, I moved posts preview to the <code>blog</code> tab. And in addition, adjusted the big image of the landing page to cover the whole page. Resized the footer to accommodate the big front image.</p>
<p>I love the post preview from the blog section. It gives a brief section to preview the content before delving fully into the post. From the original theme structure, this is presented on the front page if you use <code>/content/post/</code> structure. To avoid this, I changed it to <code>/content/blog/</code>. All my posts reside in the <code>/blog</code> subdirectory.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398851/36397317-016df4c2-15cb-11e8-986f-b33a31689bc6.jpg" alt="blog"></p>
<h2 id="end-goal">End goal</h2>
<p>Going forward, I will use this website to document my R learning path. And occasionally anything I find remotely interesting for the future me for reference purposes. More like turning my wild thoughts to written engravings. Happy blogging&hellip;</p>
<p>I cannot document all the small but significant changes I made. The best option would be to fork the site and have a look at the changes made. For the source to my website, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/rbind/asimumba">here</a></p>
<p>Edit: This is a follow-up to my previous <a href="https://asimumba.rbind.io/blog/2017-07-03-building-a-website-with-blogdown-and-hugo/">post</a></p>
