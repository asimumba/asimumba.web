      <description>It is almost not surprising to find most of the summarised data is presented in the form of a report - whose format is mainly Portable Document Format (PDF). The challenge is when you would like to access that data in a dynamic format and form - where it can be analysed, reformatted and reshaped to your desire; a requirement which is hard, if not impossible to achieve with data presented in a PDF report.</description>

      <description>On the 26 August 2017 will mark exactly one year since embarking on learning the R programming language. A year ago I had neither the foresight nor will strength of believing I would be this engrossed in the new found love for programming. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long before I found myself spending at least an hour a day playing with different skills and knowledge I had acquired. Coming from the background of playing with VBA in Excel.</description>

      <description>In this short post. I will detail my journey building my website using blogdown an R package that makes use of the static website generator Hugo. This is a great R package, written by Yihui Xie.
For starters, there is offical documentation which is so far still under developement, but nonetheless it has already covered most of the pertinent issues to get you started buiding your own desired website.
If you are coming from the Google blogspot or wordpress dungeon, then by default I will assume you are going to love this new introduction to the blogsphere.</description>
