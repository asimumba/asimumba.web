Making use of the Zambia Information and Communications, Technology Authority ([ZICTA](http://www.zicta.zm/)) data. I will walk through the data on the subscriber base, the user traffic and the cost differentials among the three mobile operators, these being: Airtel, Zamtel and MTN Zambia. In addition, internet usage and the operational data on Internet Service Providers(ISPs) will be used. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nFor this analysis, I will mainly use the following packages. The beauty with the R language is  that as a modular language, meaning it is fully extensible with add-on packages. I will make use of the `ggplot2` for visualising the data; `dplyr`, which is the package made to seamlessly handle data transformations, will be used to tweak the data to match the objectives of the analysis. The other packages are `readr` for data import.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# the packages can be installed running the following command\n# install.packges(\"ggplot2\", \"dplyr\", \"readr\", \"plotly\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe data used in this analysis can be found on the [ZICTA](http://onlinesystems.zicta.zm:8585/statsfinal/ICT%20Indicators.html) website. Since the data on the ZICTA website is not in a downloadable format. I had to turn to Microsoft Excel, with its option to mine the data from the web. The data on-line is in a format which is not very helpful to work with, so I had to clean up and reorder the data into a \"tidy\" format (each variable is a column and each observation occupying a row). The original data format can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\n![Source: ZICTA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398851/31025561-ba80b558-a54b-11e7-9e91-b3655f35d4db.png)\n\nRunning the following codes loads the data into the work environment, so we can work with it to do our analysis. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noperator_stats <- read_csv(\"operator_stats.csv\")\n\nisps <- read_csv(\"isps.csv\")\n\nnetwork_coverage <- read_csv(\"network_coverage.csv\")\n\noperator_stats <- operator_stats %>%\n  as_tibble()\n\nisps <- isps %>%\n  as_tibble()\n\nnetwork_coverage <- network_coverage %>%\n  as_tibble()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `head()` command gives a view of the first 6 rows across variables of your data by default. This allows a quick peek at your data, revealing the data types and forms; and learn how the data is laid out .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(operator_stats, 4)\nhead(isps, 4)\nhead(network_coverage, 4)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `names()` function helps to know the variables or column names in the data. This comes in hand to pick the names and variables in the analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(operator_stats) # column names \n```\n:::\n\n\nIt is important to learn the data types and the form your data assumes in your dataset. To achieve this, the `str()` function can be called. Since the the dataset has variables I am not interested in, I narrow the field with the `select()` from the `dplyr` package \nto select only variables of interest\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noperator_stats %>%\n  \n  select(\n    Number_of_PSTN_Operators,\n    \n    Number_of_Mobile_Operators,\n    \n    Number_of_Registered_SIM_Cards,\n    \n    Minutes_of_use_Monthly\n  ) %>%\n  str()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Second quarter statistics from ZICTA\n\nZICTA provides the following statistics on ICT as of the second quarter of 2017, as seen below. From these statistics, it can be seen that mobile subscription is slightly under 12.5 million subscribers, representing a penetration rate of 75.77%. On the internet side, a penetration rate is more than a one third standing at 35.88%.\n\n\n![Source: ZICTA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24398851/31039423-3acc0a34-a586-11e7-9285-78a08b5d4cd2.png)\n\n\n## Number of active users\n\nAs can be seen from the trend that spans from 2010 to the year 2017 up to Q2 statistics, there has been a relatively upward trend in active mobile user subscribers. With the period between 2010 to 2012 experiencing the biggest leap of nearly 50% change.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noperator_stats %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Year,\n                          y = Number_of_active_Subscribers)) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year,\n                           y = Number_of_active_Subscribers)) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Active subscirbers\")  +\n  ggtitle(\"Trend of Active mobile subsribers\",\n          subtitle = \"Over the period from 2010 - 2017, Q1 & Q2\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot below shows a positive correlation between the active mobile subscribers with the population estimate from the Central Statistics Office.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noperator_stats %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Population_CSO_Estimate,\n             y = Number_of_active_Subscribers)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 10)) +\n  \n  labs(x = \"Population Estimate\",\n       y = \"Number of Active subscirbers\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Population Vs.

Except for the years 2013 to 2014 and 2017 first quarter that showed a decline. Perhaps much of this decline for the 2013-2014, can be attributed to the fears the general populace had over compulsory sim registration. With fears spreading that the government was implementing this programme so they can spy on the citizens. The relevant authority made sure these fears were addressed by sensitizing the general [public](https://www.zicta.zm/Views/Articles/Sim%20Registration%20(FAQ)%20.htm) through [press](http://allafrica.com/stories/201212120613.html) releases. \n\nGiven  this was a free of charge exercise, some opted to make [money](https://www.lusakatimes.com/2013/01/30/sim-registration-as-the-process-is-absolutely-free-zicta/) by charging for registration.
